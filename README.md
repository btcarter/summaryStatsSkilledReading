# Summary Statistics for the Skilled Reading Project

## Purpose
1. Preprocess eye-tracking data by fixing participant labeling, removing excluded participants and concatenating fixation reports from each run.
1. Compute summary statistics for individuals in the Skilled Reading Project.
1. Add a predictive analysis to see if ACT can be predicted by eye tracking (or cortical) factors.

## Things to try
Predictions using ET project.
- [ ] does ACT predict reading?
- [ ] does reading predict ACT? (this was a bust but educational)

AI study - can supervised learning find key indicators for ACT scores in oculomotor reading behavior and cortical anatomy measures? What about resting data?
